# ðŸ“± Flutter Animated Task Card - Figma UI Practice â€“ Fitness Streak Card

This project is a **Flutter UI practice** where I recreated a **Figma design** into a pixel-perfect Flutter widget.  
The card represents a **Fitness Streak Tracker**, showing daily steps, streak progress, and weekly activity.
